This is a front end Javascript project that simulates a company directory. It utilizes JQuery to add, search, update, find, and delete employees in the company directory. The welcome screen contains a clickable link to the company directory page. Text items in the nav bar are hover links to each corresponding entry field. The page displays information on click of the mag icon.

# Getting Started

To get the app up and running, you'll need to clone or fork the repository by clicking the Clone button, then navigate to your machine terminal window. Change the working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made. Type git clone,and paste the url from the Clone button click. It should resemble this: git clone github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY. Press enter. Your local clone will be created. 

# Prerequisites
Since this project does not provide persistent storage in a a database, you should not need to set up an environment. The included DOM library will assist with page actions.


# Contributing
Since this was a practice project, I will not be accepting contributions.
